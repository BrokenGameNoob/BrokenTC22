# New version of BrokenTC2

## Required to compile

- Qt 6.8.0 (latest LTS known to this day)
- SDL2 installed
  - Download SDL2 from the website and extract it so that you get a path such as `C:\Libs\x86_64-w64-mingw32`
  - Add this path to the environment variables so that a variable `SDL2_DIR` points to `C:\Libs\x86_64-w64-mingw32`

You should be good to go
